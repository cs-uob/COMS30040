# Lectures

The lectures are divided into *core* and *supplementary*.  The core lectures present the material from the lecture notes, which is the core material that you will be assessed on.  This is essentially the "pure theory" of the lambda calculus and (prenex polymorphic) type systems.  Starting from Week 3, the supplementary lectures illustrate how the theory can be used to understand programming languages.  In Weeks 1 and 2, the supplementary lectures try to explain the idea of writing mathematical proofs as a form of programming.
