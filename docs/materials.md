# Teaching Materials

There is a complete set of lecture notes for the assessed part of the unit (see here for the distinction between the parts).  These notes are authoratative, you will not be assessed on anything that is not based on the contents of these notes.  

Lecture Notes

To pass the assessment, you will need to be able to write mathematical proofs.  I don't expect you to be able to do this at the start of the unit but it is a skill I expect you to have learned well by the end.
We will cover a method of writing proofs as a form of programming in the first two supplementary lectures and I provide notes on it below.

Programming Proofs

You should read these notes and listen to the accompanying lectures even if you believe you have proofs sorted, because this perspective on proofs will be revisited as part of the core material towards the end of the unit.

## Errata

The presentation of the material in this unit has undergone significant changes since last year and so I expect to find some typos.  If you think something looks wrong, it probably is, so please let me, Eddie or Sam know about it!
