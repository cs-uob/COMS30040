# Lecture Notes

* [Lecture Notes](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/notes.pdf)
* [Programming Proofs Notes](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/proofs.pdf)

There is a complete set of lecture notes for the assessed part of the unit (see here for the distinction between the parts).  These notes are authoratative, you will not be assessed on anything that is not based on the contents of these notes.  

To pass the assessment, you will need to be able to write mathematical proofs.  I don't expect you to be able to do this at the start of the unit but it is a skill I expect you to have learned well by the end (and you will get some good practice).
We will cover a method of writing proofs as a form of programming in the first two supplementary lectures which is also the subject of the second set of notes.

You should read these notes and listen to the accompanying lectures even if you already believe you can write convincing proofs, because this perspective on proofs will be revisited as part of the core material towards the end of the unit.
