Welcome to the home of COMS30040: Types and Lambda Calculus.  This unit introduces you to type theory and the pure lambda calculus, which are two hugely influential parts of logic and the theory of programming languages.  

### Workload

This is a 10 credit unit, and the unit runs during weeks 1--7.  You should expect to around 10 hours per week working on it.  There are 5 main activities:
* __Prerecorded lectures.__ At the start of each week, three prerecorded lectures will be posted on the unit website which you need to watch in your own time.
* __Problems.__ You will only learn on this unit by completing the problem sheets and exercises.  There is one sheet released each week and you are expected to work on it in your own time.
* __Online labs.__  Excepting week 1, every Tuesday there is a problem class in which our senior TAs, Eddie Jones and Samantha Frohlich will guide you through the solutions and try to help with any questions you have.
* __Lecturer Q&A.__ Excepting week 1, every Monday at 3pm there will be a one-hour Q&A with the lecturer.  In week 1, this will start at 3:30pm due to Welcome Week events.
* __Reading/Revising.__  You will often benefit from alternative explanations of the same concepts, which would not fit into the time available for lectures.  You will need to spend time revising and rethinking topics before you can solve the associated problems.

### Assessment

This unit is assessed by a written exam, conducted online in the January assessment period.
