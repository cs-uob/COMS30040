# Problem Sheets

Each week a problem sheet will be posted which you should either complete or work at for 2 hours (whichever is shorter).  The schedule is designed so that you can attempt the problem sheet already after watching the first lecture of each week (and I recommend that).

*You will only succeed on this unit by carefully attempting the problem sheets.*

| Week | Sheet |
|:-----|:------|
| 1    | [problems](problems/week1.pdf) |

The problems are graded from 1 to 3 stars.  A 1-star problem is usually just a matter of calculation after a close reading of the relevant definitions.  A 2-star problem requires some thought and possibly a proof, but it follows a similar pattern to something we saw in lectures.  A 3-star problem requires some new insight and probably an element of trial and error (a.k.a luck) because you have not seen problems of a similar shape before.

## Marking and Feedback

It is highly recommended that you submit your solutions to Eddie and Sam for marking.  You can do this by emailing a copy to your TA with deadline *5pm on Thursday*.  Your sheet will be returned to you just before the problem class.

*This means you should probably try to block out 2-3 hours of time to work on the problems on Wednesday or Thursday.*
