# Problem Sheets

Each week a problem sheet will be posted which you should either complete or work at for 2 hours (whichever is shorter).  The schedule is designed so that you can attempt the problem sheet already after watching the first lecture of each week.  In weeks 1 and 2, I recommend also watching the supplementary lecture before attempting the problem sheet because you will be asked to prove some simple logical statements.

*You will only succeed on this unit by carefully attempting the problem sheets.*

| Week | Sheet |
|:-----|:------|
| 1    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week1.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week1.pdf) |
| 2    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week2.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week2.pdf) |
| 3    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week3.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week3.pdf) |
| 4    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week4.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week4.pdf) |
| 5    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week5.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week5.pdf) |
| 6    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week6.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week6.pdf) |
| 7    | [problems](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/week7.pdf) and [solutions](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Solutions/week7.pdf) |

The problems are graded from 1 to 3 stars.  A 1-star problem is usually just a matter of calculation after a close reading of the relevant definitions.  A 2-star problem requires some thought and possibly a proof, but it follows a similar pattern to something we saw in lectures.  A 3-star problem requires some new insight and probably an element of trial and error (a.k.a luck) because you have not seen problems of a similar shape before.

As extra practice, try to prove that the pure, untyped lambda calculus is Turing-complete by following Eddie's exercises [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/teams/grp-COMS30040/Shared%20Documents/General/Problems/turing.pdf).

## Marking and the Problem Class

It is highly recommended that you submit your solutions to Eddie and Sam for marking.  You can do this by emailing a copy to your TA with deadline *5pm on Thursday*.  Your sheet will be returned to you in the problem class.

*This means you should probably try to block out 2-3 hours of time to work on the problems on Wednesday or Thursday.*

* Samantha Frohlich: sf16540
* Eddie Jones: ej16147

You have been allocated to one of the two problem classes.  It will take the form of a video call hosted on Teams, in the Class E (for Eddie) or Class S (for Sam) channel.  To attend, go to the channel at 4pm on Tuesdays and wait until a new meeting post appears and you will find a little "Join" button to one side.  Click this button to enter the class.
